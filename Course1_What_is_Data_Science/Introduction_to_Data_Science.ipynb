    "If there is a field of data science I love the most is machine learning. As a scientist, I'm really passionate about modeling data and predicting its behavior. My curiosity and programming skills have always driven me to dig deep into a problem to find creative solutions. I would love to do data visualization since as a Physics teacher in different academic backgrounds, I've always found creative and simple ways to explain complex subjects in understandable words."
